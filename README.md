# interceptor

small patch for my vimrc to replace gx functionality of netrw-gx

If you use minimalist Vim plugin manager [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), you can add to your .vimrc

    Plug 'https://github.com/tengucrow/interceptor'

and install it with `:PlugInstall`

If you want to use other browser - now you can add to your `.vimrc` something like:

    let g:InterceptorGxBrowser="x-www-browser"
